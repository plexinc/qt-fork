\section1 Description

Installing an executable target with \l{install(TARGETS)} only installs the
target's executable (except for macOS app bundles, which will copy the whole
bundle). You need to explicitly install any other libraries or plugins the
executable depends on yourself. \c{qt_generate_deploy_app_script()} is a
convenience command intended to simplify that process. It expects the
application to follow Qt's recommended install directory structure fairly
closely. That structure is based on CMake's default install layout, as
determined by \l{GNUInstallDirs} (except for macOS app bundles, which follow
Apple's requirements instead).

The command generates a script whose name will be stored in the variable named
by the \c{FILENAME_VARIABLE} option. That script is only written at CMake
generation time. It is intended to be used with the \l{install(SCRIPT)} command,
which should come after the application's target has been installed using
\l{install(TARGETS)}.

The deployment script will call \l{qt_deploy_runtime_dependencies()} with a
suitable set of options for the standard install layout.
Currently, this is only implemented for macOS app bundles built on a macOS
host and Windows executables built on a Windows host.
Cross-building a Windows executable on a Linux host, as well as similar
scenarios, are not currently supported.
Calling \c{qt_generate_deploy_app_script()} in such a case will result
in a fatal error, unless the \c{NO_UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_ERROR} option is given.

For deploying a QML application, use
\l{qt6_generate_deploy_qml_app_script}{qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script()}
instead.
