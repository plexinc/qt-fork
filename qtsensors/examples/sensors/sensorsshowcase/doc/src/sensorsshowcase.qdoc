    \section1 Overview

    On startup, the application shows a menu with buttons for the subviews for each sensor.
    The sensor views instantiate the given sensor, display the sensor's values as numbers,
    and also visualize them with a simple graphical representation.

    \section1 Main Menu

    The main view shows the title with the name of the application and a button for each
    subview laid out evenly by a \c ColumnLayout. The navigation between the subviews
    and the main menu is managed by a \c StackView.

    \section1 Accelerometer View

    The accelerometer view shows the current device acceleration values and moves around
    an image with an amount that is opposite of the device acceleration giving the image
    an inertia effect that is proportional with the movement of the device.

    Moving around the image happens in the accelerometer \c onReadingChanged method.

    Whenever there is a new accelerometer value the image translation coordinates are
    updated accordingly.

    \section1 Proximity View

    The proximity view shows an image that is enlarged whenever the proximity sensor of
    the device is covered.

    \section1 Compass View

    The compass view shows a compass image that is rotated according to the Compass sensor
    reading value making the compass turn towards north.

    \section1 Magnetometer View

    The magnetometer view displays a magnet image that is rotated around an amount that is
    decided by the rotation angle of the vector given by the x and y magnetometer values.
    This results in general in the same rotation as the compass gives, demonstrating one use
    case of how the magnetometer readings can be used. Since the magnetometer provides
    readings along all three axes, there is more freedom with how these readings can be used.

    \section1 Gyroscope View

    \image sensorsshowcase-gyroscope.png

    The gyroscope view also shows an image that is rotated around three axes with an amount
    that is calculated from the gyroscope readings. Since the gyroscope provides relative
    rotational change around the three spatial axes and the time between reading updates
    can vary, the time of the readings are stored and the rotational change is normalized
    based on the time passed between reading updates.

    By pressing the reset button the image rotation is reset to 0.
